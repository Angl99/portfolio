            Hi, I'm Anggel! I'm a software engineer with experience in creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. Essentially, I build applications that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from application architecture, development to deployment, and maintenance. 
            <br />
            My expertise lies within but not limited to JavaScript, React, SQL, Java, Spring Boot, and many popular javascript frameworks. I'm a lifelong learner (currently exploring the latest advancements in cloud computing using google infrastructure & AI!) and love movies, traveling, and trying new foods everywhere I go!</p>
